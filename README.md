# Crop-Recommendation-System
The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based web application that suggests the most suitable crop for cultivation based on soil nutrients and environmental factors. The system uses key parameters like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH Level, and Rainfall to make accurate recommendations.
